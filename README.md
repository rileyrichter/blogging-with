# Blogging With Webflow

This is a repo to hold custom code for a free Webflow cloneable blog project.

We'll have some CSS here, as well as some javascript.

The CSS will cover just a few small things. The javascript will be to init and configure an OWL slider as well as some code to hopefully make our cards a more accessible.
